### **Overview:**
In this project, we aim to utilize data to train a machine learning model to predict different stages of lung cancer. This involves an in-depth analysis of risk factors and symptoms associated with lung cancer, using a dataset of 26 discrete variables. These variables describe risk factors and symptoms and their impact on lung cancer, ranging in severity from highest (7) to lowest (1).

The dataset encompasses a broad spectrum of attributes, including demographic information, health-related variables, lifestyle choices, and potential symptoms. These attributes are primarily classified into two categories: "Lung Cancer Risk Factors" and "Lung Cancer Symptoms."

To achieve our objective, we will employ various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. These methods will be instrumental in identifying the relationships between dependent and independent variables, ultimately aiding in accurately predicting lung cancer stages.
