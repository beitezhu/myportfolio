### **1. Overview and Objectives**
##### **Overview:**
[Synology Account](https://www.synology.com/en-global/synology-account), a critical SaaS service with over 5 million users, serves as the gateway to all Synology cloud services, including QuickConnect, Active Insight, and C2. The security of Synology Account is paramount, impacting both users and the company. It also facilitates user engagement in Synology Events and community participation.

<br> In 2020, a brute force attack caused data loss and incurred about $100,000 in damages, affecting around 50 NAS users. Although the impact was limited to less than 0.1% of users, it underscored the need for enhanced product security.

##### **Objective:**

To enhance the security of our cloud service, particularly as the integration of products with the Synology Account escalates.

<br>

### **2. Problem Statement**

- **Low Adoption Rate of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Although we have released 2FA feature for more than 4 years, only a minimal 1% of users have enabled 2FA.
- **User Inaccessibility and Convenience Issues**: Many users face challenges in accessing or managing their 2FA settings, especially in scenarios such as phone loss or OTP inaccessibility. This leads to a reliance on technical support and a general reluctance to engage with existing security measures.
- **Limited Variety in Security Options**: The current security framework primarily relies on OTPs, lacking diversity in authentication methods. This limitation fails to address the varying needs and preferences of a diverse user base.
- **Need for Enhanced User Awareness and Engagement**: There is a significant gap in user understanding and involvement regarding their account's security settings. Users often do not regularly check or update their security preferences, partly due to the lack of a user-friendly interface.
- Certain legacy portals are restricted to OTP for 2FA, pending upgrades by users.

 
<br>

### **3. Approach:**

- Introduce diverse methods for straightforward multi-factor authentication (MFA) setup.
- Foster user engagement in enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) through education on its significance.
- Strengthen account security, independent of 2FA activation.

##### **Out of Scope**
- Mandatory 2FA implementation remains outside our current scope, focusing instead on voluntary adoption supported by user education and enhanced security features.

<br>

### **4. Research Methodology**

##### **Survey and Inquiry:**

- Collected 500 responses identifying the top three reasons for low MFA setup: perceived cumbersomeness, uncertainty about setup, and fear of being locked out post-setup.

##### **User Interviews:**

- Discovered issues with double password entry inconvenience and fears of losing access due to accidental app deletion.

##### **Competitive Analysis:**

- Examined Google, Microsoft, and Adobeâ€™s security login methods. Noted each offers more than two 2FA methods, including OTP and phone push notifications.

##### **Priority Definitions:**

- **P1 (Required for Launch)**: Essential features that are critical for the launch.
- **P2 (Expected for Launch)**: Important features that are planned for the launch but can be deferred if necessary.
- **P3 (Desired for Launch)**: Additional features that would enhance the product but are not crucial for the initial launch.

<br>

### **7. Released Product**
It takes about one year to release all three stages of the security features. The results of the feature release are impressive.
