### **1. Overview**
Networking is one of the most important product lines at Synology. However, the associated app has not been updated for years, leading to a poor user experience. Additionally, there has been a significant increase in IoT devices over the past five years, reaching 13 billion in 2022. This surge has been accompanied by a corresponding rise in cybersecurity incidents related to IoT devices, often due to outdated software. These developments present new security challenges and opportunities to redesign the app and develop new features, such as VLAN, to enhance security.

With the introduction of the new Wi-Fi router, I plan to redesign the app to align with the mobile-first trend and add the VLAN feature. This will offer advanced features to tech-savvy users who are concerned about security.

The software feature plus the hardware wifi 6 router fill the gap in the mid-range router market, where VLAN functionality is often lacking. This enhancement is expected to boost sales.


### **2.The Redesign of the Router App**

### **3.The New VLAN Feature Development**

##### **Trend Analysis:**

 - **Security Trend:** There has been a significant increase in IoT devices over the past five years, reaching 13 billion in 2022. There was also a corresponding rise in cybersecurity incidents related to IoT devices, often due to outdated software. This includes DDoS attacks.
 - **User Need Trend:** I analyzed **User Inquiries.** Previously, we received 3-5 inquiries per month about network security, but this number has risen to about 10 per month, with 20% specifically mentioning network isolation. User security awareness has improved.

##### **Interview and Competitor Research:**
 - **Competitor Analysis:** I conducted market research and competitive analysis to determine if other brands provide this feature, identifying a gap in the market for routers priced between $100-$200 offering network isolation. In this price range, only Ubiquiti provides routers with VLAN features.
 
 - **Sales Interview:** I had meetings with General Managers in Germany, the US, and France, seeking their suggestions on router network security. They all agreed that software network isolation will be a needed feature for high-end customers. I also presented user discussions from Reddit and our community forums.
 - **Reddit and Community Post Analysis:** I found detailed and specific needs from Reddit.

##### Three User Personas and User Scenarios

 - **Home Users**: As a home user with IoT devices, individuals with high security awareness often seek to segregate these devices into a separate network for enhanced security.
 - **Home Offices**: Users working from home offices tend to spend extended periods at home and often desire to separate their work and personal WiFi environments for better organization and security.
 - **SMBs**: Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) can integrate with managed switches to expand WiFi coverage more effectively.

### **4.The New WIFi-6 Router**
 - Tri-band Wi-Fi for easy distribution of your devices between radios, optimizing range and performance while avoiding bottlenecks.
 - Quad-core 1.8 GHz processor for snappy management and fast connection speeds, even with multiple devices connected and all features enabled.
 - Support for the new 5.9 GHz band, resulting in more dependable high-speed networks using clearer 80 and 160 MHz channels.1

### **5. Final Target Audience and Solutions** 
 - Target Audience (TA) painpoints: Home office users and SMB
    - Concerns: They needed a high-speed, secure network, as many devices in the same rooms increased security risks.
    - Budget Constraints: Most high-functionality WiFi routers with VLAN capabilities were expensive and targeted at business users.
    - Complexity Issues: Users also found high-end devices too complex to set up and maintain.
 - Solution: The latest Wi-Fi 6 router hardware combined with a new, user-friendly router app design and VLAN feature.


### **6. Outcomes** 
 In the end, the product released, leading to a 30% YoY increaseï¼Œin router product line revenue (US$3.2m).
