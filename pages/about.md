![image](../assets/image/beite_hiking.jpg)

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am a product manager and marketing professional with 7 years of experience in the tech industry. I have successfully designed and launched apps and SaaS products, specializing in Networking, Backup, and Security.

My experience has refined my skills in Product Strategy, Project Management, and Market Survey. At Synology, I led a team of over 20 engineers in developing a networking app and Web OS, where we achieved a surge in the app's App Store rating from 3 to 4.8 within just three months. Additionally, I launched a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) product for SaaS, significantly enhancing security for 5 million users.

Furthermore, my marketing and literary background enables me to understand marketing dilemmas and think from a human perspective. Professionally, Iâ€™m able to transfer business concepts into a final product. I am in interested in exploring different products and opportunies. ðŸŒ¿
