![image](../assets/image/beite_hiking.jpg)

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am a product manager and marketing professional with 7 years of experience in the tech industry. I have successfully designed and launched apps and SaaS products, specializing in Networking, Backup, and Security.

My experience has refined my skills in **Product Strategy, Project Management, and Market Survey**. At Synology, I led a team of over 20 engineers in developing a networking app and Web OS, where we achieved a surge in the app's App Store rating from 3 to 4.8 within just three months. Additionally, I launched a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) product for SaaS, significantly enhancing security for 5 million users.

Furthermore, my marketing and literary background enables me to understand marketing dilemmas and think from a human perspective. Professionally, Iâ€™m able to transfer business concepts into a final product. I am in interested in exploring different products and opportunies. ðŸŒ¿

### Hobbies
I absolutely love backpacking and have had the joy of exploring more than 10 countries. My adventures also extend underwater; I'm fascinated by freediving and scuba diving and have trained myself to hold my breath for up to 4 minutes. And back in Taiwan, there's my adorable cat waiting for me â€“ the sweetest companion one could ask for.
